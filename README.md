geoJSON
=======

I got tired of working with XML so I decided to give geoJSON a whirl. I wanted a lightweight transport format relative to XML and JSON is just the ticket. I must admit that geoJSON was a challenge but it was an emerging standard at the time so I figured it was a good thing to learn and promote.
